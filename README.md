# knight-moves

This program lets users find the knight's quickest path from one square to another over a chess board.
It consist of HTML, CSCC and JavaScript 100% written by Cas Linden, to cement his understanding of breadth first traversal.
It has an intuitive user interface, clear animations and works well on mobile devices. 
At the time of completion he felt rather proud of his ability to throw such an application together all by himself.
